These tools and scripts are meant to be temporarily used until something permanent is implemented.
They consist mainly of workarounds.

LINUX:
  HOW TO PREPARE .FTL MODEL:
    Symlink these files to the unpacked data files subfolder where the .ftl you want to edit is located:
      convertFTLtoOBJ.sh
      convertOBJtoFTL.sh
      plugins/blender/arx_addon/unpackFtl.simpleCmdLine.sh'
    Obs.: but I suggest working at a folder inside that named _blenderSafeWork (TODO:BeSure: because blender or some addon (or my mistake?) may randomly erase the working folder?), ex.: game/graph/obj3d/interactive/items/provisions/bottle_water/_blenderSafeWork/, so you also need to copy the .ftl to that work folder.
    cd to .../_blenderSafeWork and run ex.:
      blender (then import vanilla bottle_water.ftl using arx_addon)
    read: HowTo.interim.ImportExportFtl.txt or just edit and export to wavefront .obj+.mtl
    run the converter script that will guide you on preparing the final model
      ./convertOBJtoFTL.sh bottle_water # it has many dependencies validated on the top of the script
    on arx, just reloading the game F9 will update most of the models w/o requiring a restart. It seems to update textures also but only if they already exist and are in png format?
