This work "Forest Sound Effects" just creates a loop ambient sound by:
- converting from the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7asACRn27g) to wav
- removing the begin and end noises of the audio
- cleaning the background noise
- adding fade in and fade out to begin and end of the audio
- normalizing the audio
- bass amplify a bit
Adjustments made using audacity in linux.

TODO: add sound of soft wind, leaves and may be some far away water
