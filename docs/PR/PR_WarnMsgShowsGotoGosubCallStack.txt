Script CallStack, line and column  
logs will show more details for mod developers:  
- Warnings, Showlocals and showvars will show GoTo/GoSub call stack.  
- Showlocals and showvars will also show event and params  
- The script call stack now shows position, line and collumn from where each call was made  
Obs.: the column may not match your text editor as each tab on it may count as more than one column  

It now looks like ex.:  
```
[I] ScriptedInterface:257 Local variables for hologram_0004 at Event on main at GoTo/GoSub callStack functestcallstack1[p=30508,l=644,c=25] -> functestcallstack2[p=30175,l=626,c=25] -> functestcallstack3[p=30238,l=630,c=25] -> functestcallstack4[p=30301,l=634,c=25], [Position 30348, Line 638, Column 9]:
```

To test it:  
```
>>FUNCtestCallStack1 {
	GoSub FUNCtestCallStack2
	RETURN
}
>>FUNCtestCallStack2 {
	GoSub FUNCtestCallStack3
	RETURN
}
>>FUNCtestCallStack3 {
	GoSub FUNCtestCallStack4
	RETURN
}
>>FUNCtestCallStack4 {
	showvars //showlocals
	RETURN
}
On Main {
	GoSub FUNCtestCallStack1
	ACCEPT
}
```

  <summary>Obs.: about my other PR... branches</summary>
Obs.: I have many other PR_... branches, some are WIP but most are ready.  
If someone likes any of them, feel free to merge it in your own branch, test, improve etc. and create a pull request here instead of me :).
There are also many usage examples and tests on the Hologram.asl script at my ArxLaetansMod (but it depends on my fully merged dev branch).
