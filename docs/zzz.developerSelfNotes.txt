///////////// HOW TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT 'ELSE IF' ? (needs more testing tho, this should be on the 'else' command wiki description) /////////////////
// when 'if' condition fails, it will skip it's own block/commandLine AND WILL CONSUME the 'else' just after!
// when 'else' is executed, it will skip the next block/commandLine just after it.
// so, when 'if' condition succeeds, it will execute it's own block/command and will also let the 'else' just after to be executed too (what skips it's own block/commandLine, see above).
// OBS.: the problem is not when the 'if' condition fails, as it will just consume the 'else' after it, preventing it being executed, therefore allowing 'else's command/block to be executed. The problem is when 'if' succeeds, because it will execute 'else' just after it's command/block, but the evil 'else' wants to skip it's own block!!!
////// so let's code it in a way it works:
Set §test 1 //the problem is when 'if' succeeds
//// single commandLine after else
if ( §test == 1 ) {
  Set £work "ok"
} else //attention now, else will want to skip it's own commandLine, so it must be a SINGLE line after it! 
if ( §test == 2 ) Set £work "ok"
//// block after else
if ( §test == 1 ) {
  Set £work "ok1"
} else { //attention now, else will want to skip it's own block!
  if ( §test == 2 ) {
    Set £work "ok2"
  }
}
//// block for the 2nd if
Set §test 2
if ( §test == 1 ) { //block is skipped
  Set £work "ok1"
} else { // else is consumed by the above 'if-skip-self-block' so this 'else's block will be processed
  if ( §test == 2 ) {
    Set £work "ok2"
  } else { //'else' wants to skip self block now
    if ( §test == 3 ) {
      Set £work "ok3"
    } else { //'else' wants to skip self block now
      Set £work "ok3b"
    }
  }
}
// as you can see above, you need to keep nesting new 'else if' like that or it will fail because...
Set §test 1
if ( §test == 1 ) {
  Set £work "ok"
} else if ( §test == 2 ) { // ...'else' would just want to skip the next commandLine (as '{' was not imediately found after it) and then 'if(...){' would be ignored, so...
  Set £work "ok"
} //... this '}' block closure would not close the above if, but instead it could close a whole event and break the script!
