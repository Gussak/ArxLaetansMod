[Easy gather all icons]
- in a file browser, at top game dir ArxLibertatis, search for all "[icon]" files (suggested: nemo, icon view, minimum zoom has no text)
- copy them all to some folder (*1) (make sure them all RW before copying them)
- delete all undefined icons (the ones with yellow ball and "?" in the center)
- backup the folder (7z it)

- convert all to png, Linux/CygWin:
	clear;ls *.bmp |while read strFl;do convert -verbose "$strFl" "${strFl%.bmp}.png"; trash "$strFl";done

[UpScayl has no command line options so needs to be run manually]
- open upscayl
- in settings: be sure it is 4x scale
- in settings: be sure it is PNG output
- option: batch mode
- option: set the folder with the icons (*1)
- option: model: general photo (ultrasharp)
- ignore output folder setting
- click upscayl button and wait

- IF you want double upscale, Linux/Cygwin:
	Delete all files from folder (*1), least the new folder inside it: upscayl_png_ultrasharp_4x
	Symlink upscaleHelper.sh to (*1)
	Run this (minimum width OR height to accept the file):
		./upscaleHelper.sh --dupscale 128 128
	Now run this auto generated file:
		./moveSmallFilesUnique.sh
	And finally click upscayl button again and wait.
		All new files will be at upscayl_png_ultrasharp_4x.
		You can copy them to the textures folder now and they will be recognized when preparing the LOD_ICON !
