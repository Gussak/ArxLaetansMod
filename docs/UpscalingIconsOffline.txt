[Easy gather all icons]
- in a file browser, at top game dir ArxLibertatis, search for all "[icon]" files (suggested: nemo, icon view, minimum zoom has no text)
- copy them all to some folder (*1) (make sure them all RW before copying them)
- delete all undefined icons (the ones with yellow ball and "?" in the center), order by size, they all have about 12kb
- backup the folder (7z it)

- convert all to PNG (multithread), Linux/CygWin:
	clear;ls *.bmp |while read strFl;do sem -j+0 convert -verbose "$strFl" "${strFl%.bmp}.png" ';' trash "$strFl";done

[UpScayl has no command line options so needs to be run manually]
Obs.: may be tricky to work as you request, so keep trying.
- open upscayl

- SCALE MODE:
	- in settings: be sure it is 4x scale
	
- WIDTH MODE, may not work, or only work after you giveup and try the 4x mode above, then it will do 512x (the previous setting will work) :)
	- in settings: set scale to 1x (is a workaround to try force width below)
	- in settings: at width, type 511 (or other (32xN)-1 ) and click the up arrow
	
- in settings: be sure it is JPG output
- option: batch mode
- option: set the folder with the icons (*1)
- option: model: general photo (ULTRASHARP): ultrasharp is important because it keeps most black pixels totally black allowing transparency (so it is not perfect)
- ignore output folder setting
- click upscayl button and wait

- IF you want double upscale, Linux/Cygwin:
	Delete all files from folder (*1), least the new folder inside it: upscayl_png_ultrasharp_4x
	Symlink upscaleHelper.sh to (*1)
	Run this (minimum width OR height to accept the file):
		./upscaleHelper.sh --dupscale 128 128
	Now run this auto generated file:
		./moveSmallFilesUnique.sh
	And finally click upscayl button again and wait.
		All new files will be at upscayl_png_ultrasharp_4x.
		You can copy them to the textures folder now and they will be recognized when preparing the LOD_ICON !
