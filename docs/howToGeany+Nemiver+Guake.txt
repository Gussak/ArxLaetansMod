Integrating a development environment ;)

Geany (v1.38):
	- keep all source files opened, this will let navigation (identifiers clicks) work
	- use the filetype.d and follow it's install instructions, will highlight .asl files well
	- code .asl functions like: >>FUNCname () {   // pay attention to let a space between FUNCname and the '()'. the '()' are useless in .asl but will let navigation work in geany with filetype.d
	- to navigate the file list with PgUp PgDn, right click on a file and hit ESC, so the list keeps the focus

Nemiver:
	- compile to debug at CMakeCache.txt with:
		CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING      "Debug"
		CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG:STRING "-ggdb -O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer"
		SET_OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS:BOOL  OFF
	- on start hit Ctrl+Shift+B, hit Shift+TAB, Up, TAB, paste or type the function name, and hit Enter

Guake:
	To easy compile and open errors in geany:
	- configure Quick Open with:
		 geany "%(file_path)s:%(line_number)s"
		# pay attention! there is one space before the command, it is important to let you easily re-run the previous make command
		# now Ctrl+click on the left side of the file (in case there is spaces in absolute shown path)
