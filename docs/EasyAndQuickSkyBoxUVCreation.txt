in blender (the result is not 100% perfect tho):

- create a cube
- in UV, unwrap (you will probably need to rotate it 90o, so hold ctrl)
- use scale tool to align with the skybox fallen cross texture each axis individually, but if it is too difficult to align the edges, just scale again a tiny bit, you will lose 1 or 2 pixels in the edges but it is ok
- edit mesh
  - normals: recalculate inside
  - subdivide edges for the cube 10x
  - smooth vertices laplacian:
    - unckeck preserve volume
    - iter 1, lambda 172.25
    - click on background and re-select the meshaxis
    - iter 200, lambda 0.010
  - axes distribution is not 100% uniform but is ok
  - triangulate faces to work with converter to arx .ftl
  - shading: smooth faces

obs.: if it is an item, to be able to drop it, dimensions (or height) must be around 165m
