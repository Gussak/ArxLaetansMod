in blender (the result is not 100% perfect tho):

- create a cube
- in UV, it is already unwrapped as a cross. you will probably need to rotate it 90o, so hold ctrl.
- use scale tool (hold ctrl) to align with the skybox fallen cross texture with the edges. use the "UV Vertex" values to manually type the exact numbers there to fit exactly at the edges. Max zoom in to help.
- edit mesh
  - normals: recalculate inside
  - subdivide edges for the cube
    - 10x
    - smoothness 1.0
  - axes distribution is not 100% uniform but is ok as this is a "skysphere" and not a skybox
  - triangulate faces to work with converter to arx .ftl
  - shading: smooth faces
  - recalculate normals inside

obs.: if it is an item, to be able to drop it, dimensions (or height) must be around 165m
