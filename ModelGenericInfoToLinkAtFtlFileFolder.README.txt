This model filename (that is generic or unrelated to arx universe) needs to override Arx Fatalis related model.
For linux, the relative symlink is ready.
For windows, you need to run the .bat file. For that you need developer mode enabled, or use windows explorer to create the link.

The .ftl file may be imported into blender using the plugin "ArxLibertatis/plugins/blender/arx_addon".

The blender model can be converted into .ftl by exporting it with the ftl plugin (if the export is working) or by exporting it to obj/mtl and using the linux scripts convertOBJtoFTL.sh (it may work on cygwin too).

PS.: 
  Tested only on linux. instructions clarifications (like to make it work on other OS) and scripts improvements are welcome.
  Pressing F9 to reload, may update some models and may not update other models, but textures renaming/updates may need to restart the game.
