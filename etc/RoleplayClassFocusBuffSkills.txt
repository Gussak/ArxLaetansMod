Roleplay Class Focused Skills: a system to let the player roleplay focusing on a single class or multiclass skills development.

Example for 3 classes: Mage Warrior Thief

TotalSkillPointsUsedPerClass M W T;
buff applied BM BW BT;
finalvalue FM FW FT;

______________
__ Example: __

M=10 W=20 T=5

#if subtraction is < 0 it becomes 0
BM=(M-W=0)+(M-T=5)=5
BW=(W-M=10)+(W-T=15)=25
BT=(T-M=0)+(T-W=0)=0     #would be negative so becomes 0

FM=M10+BM5=15 
FW=W20+BW25=45 
FT=T5+BT0=5

___

Spreadind total class buff per Warrior skill ex.:
(the float truncs to integer to fit skills based on integer values but could round nearest on other systems)

User option: fDifficulty from 0.00 to 1.00 
0 means hardest, no bonus.
1.0 means easiest, max bonus.
So, the more classes, the more bonuses increasing the final skill value, when fDifficulty becomes handy to keep the fun of the challenge.

Following the example values and calculating for Warrior class:

PW=BW*fDifficulty/W=1.25;    #PW means Per Warrior skill point.

Wa=4 Wb=15 Wc=1   #Warrior skills a b c, used a total of 20 points (W=20 look on the top)

# skills final values
Waf=Wa+Wa*PW=9
Wbf=Wb+Wb*PW=33.75=33
Wcf=Wc+Wc*PW=2.25=2

Validate: 9+33.75+2.25=45=FW  #see FW up there

Each skill will need a new buff variable to be set every time a new skill point is spent.
Using each skill must apply the buff to the final result.
The skill book must show the buff, could hold a key, may be shift to show the buff.
Could move the mouse over to show some calculations to let the playe understand how it works.
This system could be used in other games too.
